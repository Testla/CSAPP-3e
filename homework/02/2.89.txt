A.
Because double can represent all int, x == dx, they should be converted to the same value.

B.
When x == -2, y == INT_MAX, x - y overflows.

C.
double can hold the result, so it's always true.

D.
The result may be rounded, only the first 53 bits starting from the leading one bit will be kept.
I did some test and found that when x, y, z are all non-negative,
about one third of the times the expression is false.

E.
False when one is zero and the other is not.
