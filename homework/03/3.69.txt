A.
From line 1, offset of b_struct.last is 0x120, i.e. 288.
From line 4, 5 and 6, bp->a[i] is at bp + 40 * i + 8.
So size of a_strcut is 40.
288 = 40 * CNT + 8, CNT = 7.

B.
From line 6, idx is of type long.
From line 7 and 8, a_struct.x is of type long, offset of a_struct.idx is 0x10 - 0x8 = 8.
(40 - 8) / 8 = 4

typedef struct {
    long idx;
    long x[4];
} a_struct;
